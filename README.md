# MumboJumbo

The concept for this Pearson MVP is a minigame collection design to assist with language learning. Inspired by games like WarioWare and Mario Party, the game uses a variety of fast-paced, frenetic minigames to make learning a language fun and intuitive. 

Players select their language, and once they do so they are presented with a variety of minigames with prompts to complete in the language they have chosen. If the prompt is “Shoot the hot air balloon on the left!”, for example, they are expected to do so before a timer runs out. At the end of a round consisting of more than a dozen minigames, they are graded based on their performance.

## Minigames

Currently, there are six different minigames that you can play during the course of a round. Each minigame has a variety of elements that change each time it is played in order to teach different aspects of language. For example, if you play the “Cut” minigame you will have to choose between two different objects and select the correct one in order for the minigame to count as a success. Each minigame tests your language abilities in different ways.

By randomizing the “verbs” and “nouns” in each minigame, many different options are created for each minigame and gameplay mechanic.

## End of Game Grading and Report Card System

At the end of the game, the user will be presented with a Report Card that shows how many answers they got correct, as well as a list of the prompts that they failed along with a translation. They can then restart the game or go back to the main menu.

## Known Bugs and Issues

- The report card feature currently is not set up to expand based on the size of the contents. Meaning that if you fail a large number of the minigames in a round (more than ~6) the text will bleed over off the report card.
- The shader that’s applied to the instruction text for each minigame is currently a little wonky for special characters (ex. ¡ ) that only appear after selecting to play the game in Spanish.
- The buttons in the UI often take more than 1 button press to register.
